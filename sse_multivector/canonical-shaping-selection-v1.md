# Selecting local entries to reduce overcrowding

The user approved selecting promising unused local entries when a canonical
group has too many children. A nomination still follows ordinary local versus
canonical graph traversal. Selection does not establish containment, placement,
equivalence or a preferred answer.

The [bounded selector](canonical_shaping_selection.py) ranks entries by their
second-highest cosine against eligible immediate siblings' subject vectors.
An exact match to one sibling therefore cannot alone dominate the ranking.
Each local entry retains its own source identity and native eligibility, even
when several entries have identical headings. Candidate headings share vector
computation; this does not merge entries or their meanings. Fewer than two
eligible siblings gives no grouping score. Similarity does not determine which
topic is broader.

Preparation excludes already processed entries, uses the native same-note and
mapped-parent eligibility rules, and preserves source hashes for the original
state, finished-menu candidate, corpus, implementation and SSE receipt sources.
It rejects changed canonical meanings/supports and menu links without original
graph reachability. It makes no teacher calls or new encodings. The bounded
implementation permits 4,096 local entries and 512 siblings; it scans saved
vectors and is not a corpus-scale retrieval index.

## First trial: Food preparation

The current ASv6.100 / Bootstrap-v96 / Compare-v48 fifty-note menu has seven
children beneath Food preparation C005. Preparation ranks all 1,386 unused
local entries and selects **Cooking**, local entry 4 from N011:
`51209f1582fd9e8e5f440278ba79e399f65c8b020fc0d43f07f1e67005a8bf70`.
Its context says: “How to cook” establishes cooking as a subject. The original
post asks how to cook ham-and-cheese mochi bread from Japanese convenience
stores. Its strongest eligible sibling cosines are Cooking appliances C014
0.8488, Grilling C012 0.7791 and Cookware C008 0.7612. The ranking score is 0.7791.

The ignored frozen nomination is
`target/canonical-shaping-selection-v1/food-preparation-v1.json` in the retained
task worktree `oracle-mvp-canonical-shaping-selection-v1`. The
[trial source](shr_single_pair/hierarchy-shaping-food-preparation-v1.json)
selects this original local root and the original producer/comparison specs.
It assigns no canonical destination. The trial must enable graph search;
the older sixteen-node shortlist is not a substitute.

**Status: nomination prepared; live traversal not run.** Forty-six relevant
selection, traversal, regression and vector-preparation tests passed. Actual
choice reduction, inference usage, API-equivalent cost and hierarchy-quality
preservation remain unmeasured. No production generation policy or other
agent's saved hierarchy changed, and no UI was updated.

When a new intermediate parent groups m existing siblings, replacing their
direct choices with that parent can reduce the original group by m−1 choices.
Measure the actual completed placement and menu, including any new overcrowded
group and added depth. A placement elsewhere or equivalence is not automatically
a shaping improvement. Both existing and new note routes must remain reachable,
and every retained downward step must narrow the distinct-note set.

Repeat nomination into a fresh output file:

```bash
cd /home/dev/src/notedeck_worktrees/algos/oracle-mvp
python3 sse_multivector/canonical_shaping_selection.py \
