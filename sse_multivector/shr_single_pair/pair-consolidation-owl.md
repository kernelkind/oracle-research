# Pair-consolidation-owl: experimental prompt line

`pair-consolidation-owl-v5` is the human-approved wording for this experimental
line. The user approved it with "OK LGTM." It is not activated or a replacement
for `Hierarchy-pair-consolidation-v6`. Its [first pilot](pair-consolidation-owl-pilot-v1.md)
completed sixteen GPT-6.1 Sol medium requests: twelve initial cases, two exact
repeats and two reversed-order cases. All passed structural checks and preserved
the targeted restrictions under agent review; one review remains uncertain about
how much meaning must be represented formally rather than in English glossaries.

The user approved proceeding with this separate experimental line and the
following contract:

- A supplied parent contains formal logic and English definitions for names
  that lack a formal definition, without a separate title or meaning. The
  model preserves those definitions instead of generating a parent translation.
- Both input nodes retain their fixed natural-language titles and meanings.
- Output first supplies the first node's formal definition and English
  definitions, then the second node's, then the consolidated topic's, followed
  by the consolidated natural-language title and meaning.
- Reused names preserve their supplied definitions. Required relationships
  must appear in the formal representation rather than being introduced as
  unstated English assumptions.
- Each `owl` object has `expression` first, for the topic's own expression,
  then `classes`, a JSON object of supporting class definitions. The entrypoint
  is always `owl.expression`; `owl.classes` may be empty. This same layout is
  used by the supplied parent and all three returned formal representations.
- Expressions retain the OWL-like operators. Each expression is one string;
  supporting definitions are separate JSON fields rather than newline-separated
  `Name = expression` statements in one string.
- English glossaries cover referenced names that lack a formal definition.
  They do not duplicate supporting class definitions or the topic's entry
  expression. `Parent`, `Node1`, `Node2` and `Consolidated` are guide labels for
  entry expressions, not additional class definitions. The consolidated
  natural-language title and meaning remain separate final outputs.

Wording approval and this bounded pilot do not establish general semantic
correctness or authorize activation or further inference. Outermost parentheses
are omitted from expression strings; nested parentheses preserve grouping.

## Sources and assembly

The [v5 prompt](pair-consolidation-owl-v5.md) is built by its
[pinned assembly manifest](pair-consolidation-owl-v5.assembly.json). It includes
[OWL-like guide v5](prompt_parts/owl-reasoning-guide-v5.md) and
[explicit-meaning rules v6](prompt_parts/explicit-meaning-rules-v6.md)
byte-for-byte. Its matching definition-writing reference is
[Bootstrap-v129](Hierarchy-bootstrap-v129.md).

V5 keeps one [complete input/output example](prompt_parts/pair-consolidation-owl-example-v3.md)
using the same display-panel case, with each entry expression separated from
its supporting classes. The guide distinguishes exact class definitions from
one-way containment checks; required membership implications are expressed in
the formal definitions. It does not encode a containment claim as an exact
equivalence. The shared meaning-writing rules and consolidated natural-language
meaning are unchanged. All earlier published prompt and guide files retain
their original bytes.

The notation is the simplified OWL-like notation described in the guide. The
model supplies formal definitions, not an executable OWL document or a
mechanically verified proof. There is no parser, reasoner, constructor change,
experiment adapter or activated configuration in this task.

Only two input nodes and an optional parent are supplied per call. The shared
guide adds fixed input text; formal definitions and their English definitions
add output tokens. No call reduction, token saving or correctness gain has yet
been measured against another prompt. The pilot used sixteen fresh calls with
complete saved API-equivalent cost of $0.216726; it did not generate a hierarchy.

## Offline checks

```bash
cd /home/dev/src/notedeck_worktrees/algos/oracle-mvp
python3 sse_multivector/prompt_assembly.py check \
  sse_multivector/shr_single_pair/pair-consolidation-owl-v5.assembly.json
```

Assembly checks establish exact reconstruction and unchanged shared sources.
They do not establish faithful translation, valid containment or useful
consolidation. Pilot reviews are manual and separately attributed, with no
automated reasoner proof or human semantic gold. The proposed next step is to
settle which explicit conditions require formal structure, then test a new
prompt version against the saved controls; neither is implemented or activated.
